# Scientific Calculator Web App

## Description
This project is a modern, dark-themed scientific calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced scientific functions such as sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm (base 10 and natural log), square root, power, and percentage calculations.

Users can toggle between standard mode and scientific mode to access additional functions seamlessly. The interface is designed to be clean, intuitive, and visually appealing.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /
- Scientific functions: sin, cos, tan, log (base 10), ln (natural log), square root, power (^)
- Percentage calculation
- Clear (C) and backspace (⌫) functionality
- Toggle button to switch between standard and scientific modes
- Dark-themed UI with responsive buttons and display

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with CSS variables for easy theming)
